<!-- there are three tipes of element in the html:

 1) BLOCK ELEMENT. it takes an entire line. By default
        <p> is a block element.
            If we change the width to for example 300px,
            then the only paragraph is going to be
            300px. but it still will tage the hole line

 2) INLINE BLOCK ELEMENT. takes as much space as needed.
        examples are image element and an input element. They
        dont take an entire line so u can go on on the same
        line

 3) INLINE ELEMENT. are basically text elements.
 example is <strong></strong>


 !!!!!! DISPLAY IS REQUERED TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLOCK
 AND INLINE BLOCK
